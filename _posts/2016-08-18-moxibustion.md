  Moxibustion uses heat to warm acupuncture points, and can be done during an
  acupuncture treatment or as a stand-alone treatment in conjunction with the
  needles. The moxa (dried mugwart, a medicinal herb) is lit, and burns like
  incense. The combination of the heat and the medicinal qualities of the moxa
  stimulates circulation and balances the flow of qi. The most common way to
  perform moxibustion is in the form of a moxa stick. The practitioner lights a
  cigar-like stick of moxa and holds it near the skin until that area is warm.
  Variations include small sticks of moxa in a barrier or “pot” that is laid on
  the skin, or molded moxa placed on the needle.

### Moxibustion

Moxibustion uses heat to warm acupuncture points, and can be done during an acupuncture treatment or as a stand-alone treatment in conjunction with the needles. The moxa (dried mugwart, a medicinal herb) is lit, and burns like incense. The combination of the heat and the medicinal qualities of the moxa stimulates circulation and balances the flow of qi. The most common way to perform moxibustion is in the form of a moxa stick. The practitioner lights a cigar-like stick of moxa and holds it near the skin until that area is warm. Variations include small sticks of moxa in a barrier or "pot" that is laid on the skin, or molded moxa placed on the needle.
