    Tui Na (to push, to pull) is a Chinese-style massage performed before or
    after an acupuncture treatment. Tui Na is different than a Swedish-style
    massage, as its techniques are more vigorous. It involves manipulating the
    tissue with intention to free course the qi in the body and relieve
    stagnation or pain.
