**Make sure to eat something light an hour or two before arriving**

### Nutrition and Chinese herbal medicine

After an acupuncture treatment, nutritional guidelines with specific food choices are promoted and Chinese herbs/formulas are prescribed. Both the guidelines and prescriptions are specific to the patient and what is being treated; symptoms and underlying causes of the ailment are considered.

Acupuncture may be identified with the needle, but our practitioners will be using adjunct therapies (cupping, massage, gua sha, moxibustion) individually or as a combined action, to assist those needles in providing a longer-lasting, more profound effect in your healing process throughout your course of treatment.

Electrical stimulation acupuncture (e-stim or acu-stimulation)

During an acupuncture treatment, the needles can be attached to a device that generates continuous electric pulses using small clips. This device can adjust the frequency and intensity of the impulse being delivered, depending on the condition the patient is being treated for. E-stim acupuncture uses two needles at a time so that the impulses can pass from one needle to the other. Several pairs of needles can be stimulated simultaneously. This technique is a popular and effective clinical application for pain.
