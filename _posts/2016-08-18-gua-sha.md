  Gua sha (to scrape) is used to treat pain, remove toxins, improve circulation
  and move stuck qi. Gua sha is done after an acupuncture treatment, usually to
  the neck, shoulders or back. Oil is applied to specific areas and gently
  scraped (without breaking the skin) with a smooth tool like a spoon, piece of
  jade or stone. The strokes follow the direction of the ribs and spine, and
  leave distinctively long, temporary red patches on the skin.
