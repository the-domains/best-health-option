  Cupping is a suction technique done to alleviate pain and release toxins (sha)
  held in the body. Fire cupping is the most common form of cupping. To do this,
  the practitioner uses a round glass cup with an opening between 1-4 inches. A
  flame is briefly put inside the cup to heat the air. The flame is then removed
  and the cup is quickly placed on the skin. As the air cools inside the cup, a
  partial vacuum is created and the cup sucks onto the skin. Cupping can be
  stationary, where the cup is left over a specific point for up to ten minutes,
  or sliding, where oil is applied to the skin and the cup is slid over the
  area. Cupping can vary in intensity and pressure, depending on technique. In
  both cases, the vacuum inside the cup pulls on the skin to create the
  therapeutic effect. Single/multiple cups can be used with either technique.
